This study has staggering implications, especially for individual privacy, and has sparked a great deal of discussion and controversy. Dr. Michal Kosinski and Mr. Yilun Wang, the authors of the study, will be giving a talk and Q&A session, hosted by SAIG.\nWe suggest that audience members read the study beforehand, but it is not required.
